\section{Order Book (market/book/)}
This module implements the data structure behind a limit order book: two sorted lists of orders, one for the bid and one for the ask sides, and maintains the status of the limit orders. Due to this separation of concerns, the module is used both by the \texttt{Market~Agent} (\Cref{Chapters/Implementation/Market-Agent}) and \texttt{Client~API} (\Cref{Chapters/Background/Client-API}) modules, thus contributing to requirement \textit{N03}.

Following the principles outlined in \Cref{Chapters/Implementation/Overall-Principles}, an interface is defined in \\ \texttt{eugene.market.book.OrderBook} that specifies the methods for inserting new orders, executing and cancelling existing orders, and inspecting the orders at the top of the book. There are two implementations: \texttt{eugene.market.book.impl.DefaultOrderBook} and a delegate \texttt{eugene.market.book.impl.ReadOnlyOrderBook}, both hidden in a private package behind \texttt{eugene.market.book.OrderBooks} factory.
