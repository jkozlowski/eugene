\section{jade-unit}
In order to fulfil requirement \textit{NF04}, there needs to be a way to create and tear down an arbitrary number of \texttt{JADE} containers, potentially within a single JVM. Being able to do that would allow for reuse of existing testing tools and frameworks. 

There exists a \texttt{Test Suite Framework} available through the official \texttt{JADE} website, however it seemed like maintaining two entirely different testing environments would be an unnecessary complication.

Unfortunately, the \textit{JADE} version as available on the official website contains a messaging module for sending messages to external nodes that opens a socket, and renders creating multiple \texttt{JADE} containers impossible.

Luckily, \texttt{JADE} architecture is modular and hence the implementation of the messaging module can be replaced. \texttt{jade-unit} extension implements a no-op messaging module that simply ignores any messages directed to it.
