\begin{itemize}
\item Outline the problem you are working on, why it is interesting andwhat the challenges are.\item List your aims and goals. An aim is something you intend to achieve (e.g., learn a new programming language and apply it in solving the problem), while a goal is something specific you expect to deliver (e.g., a working application with a particular set of features).\item Give an overview of how you carried out the project (e.g., an iterative approach).\item A brief overview of the rest of the chapters in the report (a guide to the reader of the overall structure of the report).
\end{itemize}This chapter is relatively short (2-4 pages) and must leave the reader very clear on what the project is about and what your goals are.
