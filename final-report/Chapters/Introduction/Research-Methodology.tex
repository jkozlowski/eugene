\section{Research methodology}

In order to design a stock market simulator, the first step is to study the relevant aspects of real stock markets, therefore we study the literature on market microstructure of electronic, limit order book stock markets.

Similarly, in order to realistically model the behaviour of a stock market as a whole, we turn to analyse existing Agent-Based Artificial Stock Markets. We specifically focus on the types of behaviours that are modelled in order to choose an appropriate implementation for the Noise Traders.

The results of the analysis of stock markets and Agent-Based Artificial Stock Markets enables us to design a flexible and modular framework for the simulator, that effectively mirrors the features of real stock markets. 

After designing and developing the simulator, the efficacy in discovering errors in Trading Algorithms will be evaluated by performing two experiments that correspond to the two null hypotheses. By introducing the simulator and demonstrating its usefulness in discovering errors in Trading Algorithms we aim to provide a methodological advancement that will be a useful complement to traditional ways of testing Trading Algorithms.
