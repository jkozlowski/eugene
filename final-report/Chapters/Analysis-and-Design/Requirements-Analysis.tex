\section{Requirements Analysis}
Having analysed available literature on the design of asynchronous, limit order book markets in \Cref{Chapters/Background/Market-Microstructure}, as well as existing Agent-Based ASMs in \Cref{Chapters/Background/Agent-Based-Modelling}, we will now list the requirements that the trading simulator needs to satisfy.

Requirements are prioritised according to the MoSCoW approach:

\begin{itemize}
\item M - Must - These requirements are the highest priority must be completed to ensure project success.
\item S - Should - These requirements are high priority and will be completed after the M requirements.
\item C - Could - These requirements will be worked on only if there is time after the M and S requirements or if they do not interfere with the progress of the higher priority tasks.
\item W - Would - These requirements most probably will not be done and are not necessary for the completion and success of the project but are good ideas for future work.
\end{itemize}
