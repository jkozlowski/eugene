In this Chapter we describe main elements of an Algorithmic Trading System and Eugeneâ€™s place in that architecture. We provide a summary of the main requirements and principles that informed the design of the simulator and the pseudo code for the algorithms implemented for the Noise Traders and VWAP Traders.

\begin{itemize}
\item Give the detailed problem statement.\item A structured list of requirements.\item Use cases (a use diagram and list of use case titles, with the full use cases appearing in the appendix).
\item Results of analysing the requirements to extract information. For example, data modelling to find the data to be stored (ER diagram), views/web pages needed and so on.
\end{itemize}The level of detail of the requirements and use cases will depend on the nature of your project. If you are doing a Software Engineering based design and implementation project, then they will need to be done thoroughly.The length of this chapter depends on the kind of project, but you are typically looking at 5-6 pages.
