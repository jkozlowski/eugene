\begin{itemize}
\item Outline and reference the sources of information you are drawing on(papers, books, websites, etc.). State how each relates to your work.\item If relevant, a survey of similar programs or applications to yours, and how yours is differentiated.\item Outline the software, tools, library code, frameworks and similar that you are using.
\end{itemize}You should not include well known things (e.g., HTML or Java) or try to give tutorials on how to use a tool or code library (use references to books and websites for that information). Everything you include should be directly relevant to your work and the relationship made clear. This chapter is likely to be fairly substantial, perhaps 8-10 pages.
