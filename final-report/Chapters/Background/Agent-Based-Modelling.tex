\section{Agent-Based Modelling}
\label{Chapters/Background/Agent-Based-Modelling}

In this section we summarise several artificial stock markets from the available literature. We provide a model of zero-intelligence agents that will be implemented by the Noise Traders, that is based on the work by~\citet[chap.~4]{Gilles2006}. Moreover, in order to provide a background for implementing a VWAP Trading Algorithm for the experiments, we survey available sources, most prominently the work in~\cite{Coggins2006, Kakade2004}.
